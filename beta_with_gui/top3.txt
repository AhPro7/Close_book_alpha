Look at Data •5visualizations have their own rhetoric of plausibility.

For convenience, we cansay that our problems tend to come in three varieties. Some arestrictlyaesthetic.T h eg r a p hw ea r el o o k i n ga ti si ns o m ew a ytacky, tasteless, or a hodgepodge of ugly or inconsistent designchoices. Some are substantive . Here, our graph has problems thatare due to the data being presented. Good taste might makethings look better, but what we really need is to make betteruse of the data we have, or get new information and plot thatinstead. And some problems are perceptual . In these cases, evenwith good aesthetic qualities and good data, the graph will beconfusingormisleadingbecauseofhowpeopleperceiveandpro-cess what they are looking at. It is important to understand thatthese elements, while often found together, are distinct from oneanother.Bad tasteLet’sstartwiththebadtaste.

Look at Data •9Bad dataIn your everyday work you will be in little danger of produc-ing either a “Monstrous Costs” or a “Napoleon’s Retreat.” You aremuch more likely to make a good-looking, well-designed figurethatmisleadspeoplebecauseyouhaveusedittodisplaysomebaddata. Well-designed figures with little or no junk in their compo-nentpartsarenotby themselves adefenseagainstcherry-pickingyour dataor presentinginformation inamisleadingway. Indeed,it is even possible that, in a world where people are on guardagainstjunkyinfographics,the“haloeffect”accompanyingawell-produced figure might make it easierto mislead some audiences.Or,perhapsmorecommon,goodaestheticsdoesnotmakeitmuchharderforyoutomisleadyourselfasyoulookatyourdata.In November 2016 the New York Times reported on someresearch on people’s confidence in the institutions of democracy.It had been published in an academic journal by the political sci-entists Yascha Mounk and Roberto Stefan Foa.
